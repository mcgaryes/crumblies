# Discussion 002 - Extending Prototypes

### Overview

In this disscussion we'll look at how you can use classical inheritance (which was discussed in [discussion one](https://github.com/mcgaryes/crumblies/tree/master/js101/discussions/001), `Object.create` and the `Function.call` method to create extendable JavaScript Objects.

This discussion does not discuss the concept of JavaScript "mixins", the practice of inheriting from multiple object prototypes. That will be covered in the next discussion! So stay tuned! 

### Discussion Questions

* How would you possibly go about using this functionality in non-supported browsers?
* How else could you possibly extend one prototype with another?
* Have you ever used this type of functionality in any of your projects?
