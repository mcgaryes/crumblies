# Discussion 002 - Prototype Mixins

### Overview

This discussion build on the previous two, [Prototypal Inheritence](https://github.com/mcgaryes/crumblies/tree/master/js101/discussions/001) and [Extending Prototypes](https://github.com/mcgaryes/crumblies/tree/master/js101/discussions/002). In this lesson however we'll take those concepts discussed earlier and show how a single instance can inherit from multiple object [prototypes], which we'll refer to as "mixins".

We'll continue using the `Object.create` and `Function.call` methods and add in some functionality that takes advantage of the `Object.keys` and `Array.forEach` methods available to ECMAScript 5.

### Discussion Questions

* How could you write a more dynamic mixin function?
