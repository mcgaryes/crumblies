  "readme": "# MonkeyBars\n\nA task based library that provides a simple structure for handling singular, sequential and parallel units of code. \n\nThe overall architecture is based off of the [composite](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite%20pattern) and [decorator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) patterns. These patterns lend themselves very well to a task based library, where tasks can contain other tasks all contributing to the overall flow of an operation.\n\nThis library also makes it possible to run tasks [concurrrently](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing) with help of HTML5 [WebWorkers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Using_web_workers) and [Blobs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Blob).\n\n### Installation\n\nThe library itself has no hard ties to the browser, and because of this it works both in client side & server side javascript projects. Include *monkeybars.min.js* for your client side projects or install using [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/monkeybars) by running the following command from within your project:\n\n<pre>\n$ npm install monkeybars [-g]\n</pre>\n\n### Examples\n\nExamples for the library can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/mcgaryes/monkeybars/tree/master/examples) directory of this project.\n\n### Documentation\n\nThere are detailed explanations for different aspects of the library available within the wiki pages.\n\n* [Concurrency](https://github.com/mcgaryes/monkeybars/wiki/Concurrency)\n* [Decorating Tasks](https://github.com/mcgaryes/monkeybars/wiki/Decorating-Tasks)\n* [Dependency Mapping](https://github.com/mcgaryes/monkeybars/wiki/Dependency-Mapping)\n* [Extending Tasks](https://github.com/mcgaryes/monkeybars/wiki/Extending-Tasks)\n* [Nesting](https://github.com/mcgaryes/monkeybars/wiki/Nesting)\n* [Product-Manipulation](https://github.com/mcgaryes/monkeybars/wiki/Product-Manipulation)\n* [Runtime Insertion](https://github.com/mcgaryes/monkeybars/wiki/Runtime-Insertion)\n* [Task Implementation](https://github.com/mcgaryes/monkeybars/wiki/Task-Implementation)\n* [Task Options](https://github.com/mcgaryes/monkeybars/wiki/Task-Options)\n\nAPI documentation, including methods and properties available to task types, can be seen [here](http://mcgaryes.github.com/monkeybars/docs/).\n",
